            <td width="50%">By
              2009, Wizkid signed a record deal with Empire Mates Entertainment. This
              deal drew the stage curtains wide open for the spotlight to be on
              Wizkid. You can see that he grabbed hold of that opportunity as his life
              depended on it. By 19, he co-wrote a song by Banky W titled “Omoge You
              Too Much”, which served as the beginning of his dealings with popular
              Nigerian artists. He also took his time to master the art of music,
              after he dropped out of school twice. Having had close to enough
              experience at hand, he started working on his debut studio album titled,
              ‘Superstar’ in 2009. He dropped the lead single off the album titled
              ‘Holla at Your Boy’ and his life never remained the same!! Immediately
              after the release of the lead single, it was nominated as the Best Pop
              Single, it also earned Wizkid the Next Rated Award at the Headies in
              2011. The Video of the lead single also earned him the Award of the Most
              Gifted New Comer Video in 2011 at Channel O Music Video Awards. Having
              realised how good his craft was, Wizkid went on to release ‘Superstar‘
              on June 12th 2011. Wizkid received a lot of awards for this album, but
              the greatest of all was the fame that came with it. He received both
              local and international recognition, which led him to tour London and
              perform at the HMV Apollo on 4th June 2012, as if that wasn’t enough, he
              went on to perform alongside Kendrick Lamar and others, in Brixton.</td>

            <td width="50%">Growing up for Wizkid wasn’t as easy as a lot of people imagined it to
              be. In a radio interview with Tim Westwood, Wizkid stated that he grew
              up in a polygamous family that left him with 12 sisters and 2
              stepmothers because his father married 3 wives. His inspiration for
              music came about when he was at the primary level of his education. He
              grew up listening to the likes of Fela Kuti, one of Nigeria’s, and
              Africa’s prominent political activists and Pan-Africanist who at that
              time was a popular singer as well. it is safe to state fact that Wizkid
              got a great part of his motivation from the Nigerian Icon. Wizkid
              dropped his first Album in 2001 with a group of children from his
              church, a group that he created and named the ‘Glorious five’. At that
              time, he was called ‘Lil Prinz’ and the album consisted of 7 tracks.
              This marked the beginning of his journey and at that time, there was no
              arguing the fact that he was going to become famous since it was clear;
              he had the talent and the willingness to let it shine!! Wizkid later
              changed his name from ‘Lil Prinz’ to ‘Wizkid’ in 2006 after he met a new
              producer that prevented him from recording a new song for some time.</td>
